## **PLEASE DO NOT USE, ACCIDENTALLY PUSHED NEW VERSION TO PRIVATE DIRECTORY, WILL UPDATE SOON**
Presently, this is a singular Rscript containing a singular function of the form:

TreeCollapse.signal.noise(freqs,subratevector,ratevector,treePath)

An example call of the function is:
TreeCollapse.signal.noise(freqs=c(0.34,0.16,0.32,0.18),subratevector=c(5.26,8.15,1,2.25,3.16,5.44),ratevector=c(rep(0.05,500)),treePath="test.tre")
